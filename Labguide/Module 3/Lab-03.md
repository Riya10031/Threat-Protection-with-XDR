# Lab 03 - Investigate an Incident

## Estimated timing: 20 minutes

You are a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that implemented Microsoft Sentinel. You already created Scheduled and Microsoft Security Analytics rules. The Fusion and Anomalies Analytics rules are also enabled in your environment. Now is the time to investigate the Incidents created by them.

An incident can include multiple alerts. It is an aggregation of all the relevant evidence for a specific investigation. The properties related to the alerts, such as severity and status, are set at the incident level. After you let Microsoft Sentinel know what kinds of threats you are looking for and how to find them, you can monitor detected threats by investigating incidents.

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will perform the following:
 - Task 1: Investigate an incident

### Task 1: Investigate an incident

In this task, you will investigate a Microsoft Sentinel incident by reviewing its details, changing its status to Active, adding tags and comments, and running playbooks. You'll also assign the incident to yourself, explore related alerts and entities, and eventually close the incident after performing a detailed investigation.

1. Select the Microsoft Sentinel Workspace you created earlier.

1. Select the **Incidents** page under **Threat management** from the left side blade and Review the list of incidents.

    >**Note:** The Analytics rules are generating alerts and incidents on the same specific log entry. Remember that this was done in the *Query scheduling* configuration to generate more alerts and incidents to be utilized in the lab.
  
1. Select one of the **Startup RegKey (1)** incidents. click on the **<< (2)** icon appear on the right side.Review the incident details on the right blade that opened. Scroll down and select the **View full details (3)** button.

    > **Note**: If you don't see any playbook listed, that is the default behaviour of azure portal because if the playbook has not run or if it has child playbook to run only then it will appear on the run playbooks option, the playbooks which are not already ran.

1. Close the *Alert playbooks* blade by selecting the **X** icon in the top right.

1. Review the **Entities** window. At least the *Host* entity that we mapped within the KQL query from the previous exercise should appear. **Hint:** If no entities are shown, refresh the page.

1. **Hover** the svm-server entity icon and wait for new *exploration queries* to be shown. It looks like *Related Alerts* has more data on it. Select the name of the exploration query **Related Alerts** to bring them to the investigation graph or select **Events >** to investigate them with a KQL query.
