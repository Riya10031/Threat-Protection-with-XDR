    ```

### Task 4: Command and Control Attack with DNS

>**Note:** Perform this task in your LAB-VM (svm).

In this task, you will create a PowerShell script that simulates DNS queries to a C2 server and run it in the background using Command Prompt. This script will generate log entries over time for later use in the Threat Hunting lab, allowing DNS resolution errors to occur as expected.

1. Copy and run this command to create a script that will simulate a DNS query to a C2 server:

    ```CommandPrompt
    notepad c2.ps1
    ```

1. Select **Yes** to create a new file and copy the following PowerShell script into *c2.ps1*.

    >**Note:** Pasting into the virtual machine file might not show the full script length. Make sure the script matches the instructions within the *c2.ps1* file.

    ```PowerShell
    param(
        [string]$Domain = "microsoft.com",
        [string]$Subdomain = "subdomain",
        [string]$Sub2domain = "sub2domain",
        [string]$Sub3domain = "sub3domain",
        [string]$QueryType = "TXT",
        [int]$C2Interval = 8,
        [int]$C2Jitter = 20,
        [int]$RunTime = 240
    )
    $RunStart = Get-Date
    $RunEnd = $RunStart.addminutes($RunTime)
    $x2 = 1
    $x3 = 1 
    Do {
        $TimeNow = Get-Date
        Resolve-DnsName -type $QueryType $Subdomain".$(Get-Random -Minimum 1 -Maximum 999999)."$Domain -QuickTimeout
        if ($x2 -eq 3 )
        {
            Resolve-DnsName -type $QueryType $Sub2domain".$(Get-Random -Minimum 1 -Maximum 999999)."$Domain -QuickTimeout
            $x2 = 1
        }
        else
        {
            $x2 = $x2 + 1
        }    
        if ($x3 -eq 7 )
        {
            Resolve-DnsName -type $QueryType $Sub3domain".$(Get-Random -Minimum 1 -Maximum 999999)."$Domain -QuickTimeout
            $x3 = 1
        }
        else
        {
            $x3 = $x3 + 1
        }
        $Jitter = ((Get-Random -Minimum -$C2Jitter -Maximum $C2Jitter) / 100 + 1) +$C2Interval
        Start-Sleep -Seconds $Jitter
    }
    Until ($TimeNow -ge $RunEnd)
    ```

1. In the Notepad menu, select **File** and then **Save**. 

1. Go back to the Command Prompt window, enter the following command and press Enter.

    ```CommandPrompt
    Start PowerShell.exe -file c2.ps1
    ```
    
    ![Lab overview.](../media/cmd.png)
   
    >**Note:** You will see DNS resolve errors. This is expected.

    >**Important**: Do not close these windows. Let this PowerShell script run in the background. The command needs to generate log entries for some hours. You can proceed to the next task and next exercises while this script runs. The data created by this task will be used in the Threat Hunting lab later. This process will not create substantial amounts of data or processing.

### Task 5: Privilege Elevation Attack with User Add

>**Important:** The next steps are done on a different machine than the one you were previously working on. Look for the Virtual Machine name references.
