# Lab 01 - Review and explore sentinel workspace

### Estimated Duration: 30 minutes

In this lab, participants will explore a pre-configured Azure Sentinel workspace, investigating security incidents, configuring automated responses, and analyzing data to strengthen threat detection and response capabilities within the Azure environment.

You are a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that is implementing Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Your manager plans to onboard a few devices to provide insight into required changes to the Security Operations (SecOps) team response procedures.
You start by initializing the Defender for the Endpoint environment. Next, you onboard the initial devices for your deployment by running the onboarding script on the devices.

## Lab objectives
 In this lab, you will perform the following:
 - Task 1: Log in to Azure Portal
 - Task 2: Explore Sentinel workspace
