# Threat Protection with XDR - Mitigate threats using Microsoft 365 Defender - 5
### Overall Estimated Duration: 60 minutes
## Overview

In this lab, you will act as a Security Operations Analyst at a company that has implemented Microsoft Defender XDR solutions. Your task is to view alerts within incidents to assess their impact, conduct root cause investigations, and mitigate these alerts using Microsoft 365 Defender tools. You will perform key tasks, including onboarding devices, managing incidents, and investigating alerts in the M365 Defender portal.

## Objective

Understand how to utilize Microsoft 365 Defender to enhance security operations and effectively manage incidents. Gain skills in onboarding devices, managing incidents, and investigating alerts. By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- **Onboard a Device**: Learn how to onboard devices to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, ensuring they are monitored for security threats and visible in the Defender portal.
- **Manage Incidents**: Understand how to navigate the M365 Defender portal to manage incidents, including editing incident details, classifying incidents, and assigning them to users or groups.
- **Investigate Alerts**: Gain practical skills in investigating security alerts, including analyzing suspicious behavior, running advanced queries, and utilizing deep analysis for thorough investigations.

## Prerequisites

Participants should have:

- **Basic Understanding of Microsoft 365 Defender**: Familiarity with Microsoft 365 Defender functionalities and interface.
- **Knowledge of Security Concepts**: Basic knowledge of cybersecurity concepts and incident response procedures.
- **Access to Microsoft 365 Defender**: A valid Microsoft 365 Defender account with necessary permissions.


## Architecture

In this lab, the architecture leverages Microsoft 365 Defender to manage security incidents effectively. You will onboard devices to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, enabling continuous threat detection. The Microsoft 365 Defender portal serves as the central management interface, where analysts can view alerts, manage incidents, and perform investigations. The incident management system aggregates alerts from various sources, providing context for security events. Additionally, advanced hunting allows for custom queries to investigate incidents further, while automation features streamline response actions to enhance incident management and threat mitigation.

## Explanation of Components

The architecture for this lab involves the following key components:

- **Microsoft 365 Defender Portal**: This is the primary interface for security operations analysts. It provides a centralized view of alerts, incidents, and investigation tools, enabling efficient management of security threats across the organization.

- **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**: This component offers advanced endpoint protection and detection capabilities. It continuously monitors devices for potential threats, allowing for real-time identification and response to security incidents.

- **Incident Management System**: This system aggregates alerts generated from various sources, helping analysts manage and investigate incidents. It provides context by linking related alerts and identifying affected devices and users.

- **Alert System**: The alert system collects and categorizes security alerts from Microsoft Defender products and other integrated services. This component is critical for identifying potential security threats and prioritizing responses.

- **Advanced Hunting**: This feature allows analysts to perform custom queries on the data collected by Microsoft Defender. It enables deeper investigations into specific incidents and patterns, helping analysts uncover hidden threats.

- **Automation and Response Capabilities**: Microsoft 365 Defender includes tools for automating response actions based on predefined rules. This helps streamline incident management and enhances the efficiency of threat mitigation efforts.
